# ETH-Proof-Beginner
This course was created to present some very fundamental Web3 topics and provide an introduction to solidity programming. I gained knowledge of different Solidity topics, including variables, datatypes, functions, etc. Making my own token is a problem, as is getting all of these items to work as a submission.

## Description

My own token, "VIOM,"  abbreviated as "VOM," was designed by me. A record of its whole supply is available. Additionally, the overall supply of VOM tokens will increase if new ones are minted. Additionally, if those tokens are burned, the amount will be deducted from the total supply (but only if there is sufficient balance).

## Getting Started
As a resource, I used Metacrafters ETH Proof while writing the code in Solidity Language.

### Installing

For writing the solidity code, I only utilised the Online Remix IDE. Then I published the same code on GitHub by creating a file called Submission.sol in this repository.

### Executing program

You can easily compile the code from the side menu if you're using Remix IDE. You must deploy the Contract from the side bar itself after compilation. You must specify certain inputs that the Smart Contract demands after deployment.

## Help

For more of this type of stuff, I'd strongly suggest visiting the Metacrafters academy. They were really helpful to me, and their discord server was quite active with kind and helpful community members!
